## Tinkering with Spotify playlists

Tinkerlist is a personal project to deal with the overhwhelming amount of playlists I have accumulated over time. The goal is to draw out my playlists via a Spotify API, and provide various functions like sort by genre or year. This should be able to be done via a web app.

It is currently in early planning stages. I would love to hear your input!

## But Spotify already lets you sort your songs. Why do you need a sorter?
Spotify has really limited sorting capabilities within your playlists. Your ability to sort under 'Songs' lets you sort under a few more categories, however it doesn't contain any of the songs in your playlists unless you have saved them all.

This is a big problem for me - spotify's discover weekly playlist is excellent, and checking out playlists by friends is also great. But I'm getting overwhelmed by the number of playlists I have accumulated, some playlists are huge, and I don't know when the music was made or what genre of music is in a list; there's just so much information that I end up not knowing anything about what I'm listening to. Hence Tinkerlist.
