## Tinkering with Spotify playlists

Tinkerlist is a personal project to deal with the overhwhelming amount of playlists I have accumulated over time. The goal is to draw out my playlists via a Spotify API, and provide various functions like sort by genre or year. This should be able to be done via a web app.

It is currently at the earliest planning stages.
